Nathan Hull
CIS658 Final Project
Student's Travelling Expense Report


This project was inspired by my own interview season. I found that a lot of companies share an "interview season," and tracking receipts for expenses can become tedious. This program would provide a way for interviewees to maintain records of their expenses, separated by company. Some cursory information is stored for each company, like the location and contact information of the contact. Each company has "Entries" associated with it, where expenses, how much they were, and when they were can be stored.

A quick Google search didn't turn up any product directly for this function. Perhaps Google Slides would work, but an online app more specifically focused could be better, as more features are extended like storing the digital receipts, fast export features, or even real-time syncing with the companies themselves.

I planned to use the active_export library for Rails, to implement a csv/xml/exl export function. Unfortunately, I ran out of time to implement it beyond getting the libraries set up. I would have added a custom API endpoint for the frontend to hit on a button-press.

Linter-jshint was used with Atom, because my JavaScript is weaker, so I don't know the best practices for the language.
